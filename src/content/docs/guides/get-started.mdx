Getting started with SamHooks is as much easy as intalling a `npm` package.

## Install

In your `React` project execute this command:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm install @tecnosamba21/sam-hooks
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @tecnosamba21/sam-hooks
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @tecnosamba21/sam-hooks
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note
SamHooks is a **React hooks library** so it is required to use it in a React project. To initialize a React project use the command bellow:

```bash
pnpm create vite@latest
```

## Usage

You can import the package into one of your components as this way:

```tsx "@tecnosamba21/sam-hooks"
import { /* The hook you want */ } from '@tecnosamba21/sam-hooks'
```
